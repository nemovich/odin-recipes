    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I thought I had Arborio rice but I obviously did not. Orzo pasta makes a delightful risotto with help from spring veggies like asparagus and peas. For service, garnish with some freshly grated Grana Padano cheese and chopped parsley.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups vegetarian chicken-flavored broth</li>

        <li>2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>

        <li>½ medium yellow onion, diced</li>

        <li>¾ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour vegetarian chicken broth and vegetable broth into a medium saucepan over over medium heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cover until needed.</li>
        <li>Melt butter and oil together in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add onion, pepper flakes, and a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Cook and stir for about 4 minutes before adding the zucchini and another pinch of sea salt. Stir and continue to cook for about 3 minutes. Next, stir in the dry orzo pasta and continue to cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes.</li>
